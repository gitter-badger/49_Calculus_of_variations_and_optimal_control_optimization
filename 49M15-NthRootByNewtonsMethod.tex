\PMlinkescapeword{formula}
The Newton's method is very suitable for computing approximate values of higher $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ \PMlinkname{roots}{NthRoot} of positive numbers (and odd roots of negative numbers!).\\

The general recurrence formula 
$$x_{k+1} \;=\; x_k-\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$$
of the method for determining the zero of a function $f$, applied to 
$$f(x) \;:=\; x^n\!-\!\alpha$$
whose zero is $\sqrt[n]{\alpha}$, reads
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} \:=\; \frac{1}{n}\left[(n\!-\!1)x_k+\frac{\alpha}{x_k^{n-1}}\right].
\end{align}
For a radicand $\alpha$, beginning from some initial value $x_0$ and using (1) repeatedly with successive values of 
$k$, one obtains after a few steps a sufficiently accurate value of $\sqrt[n]{\alpha}$ if $x_0$ was not very far from the searched root.\\

Especially for cube root $\sqrt[3]{\alpha}$, the formula (1) is
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} \:=\; \frac{1}{3}\left[2x_k+\frac{\alpha}{x_k^2}\right].
\end{align}
For example, if one wants to compute $\sqrt[3]{2}$ and uses\, $x_0 = 1$, already the fifth step gives 
$$x_5 \;=\; 1.259921049894873$$
which \PMlinkescapetext{contains fifteen right} decimals.
